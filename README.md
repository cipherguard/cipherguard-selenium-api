## About Cipherguard Selenium API

This is a CakePHP plugin to provide additional endpoints needed by the Cipherguard API 
to run selenium integration tests. These endpoints enable for example reset of databases,
changes in the configuration and are therefore not safe to be kept in a production environment.
